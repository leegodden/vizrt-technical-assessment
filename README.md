# Vizrt Technical Assessment Documentation

This is an example of fetching users data from a simple external api (in this case https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), displaying thier details into a form, adding to a table and then exporting to an excel file. This app consists of a dropdown which users can use to select a user from the api above. Upon selecting the user from the dropdown the details for that user will be displayed in a form. The user can then add these details to a table by clicking the 'Add user button' on the form.

After the forms button is clicked, the form will clear and the button will be disabled to ensure that an empty row cannot be added. Up to ten users can be added from the form and into the table. The table of users can also be exported to an Excel file with the 'Export Table to Excel' button above the table. The app is fully responsive for a variety of different screen sizes.

This is of course a simple example but could be easily scaled up to use a more complex api which could include further dropdowns along with a larger form etc

# Tools/applications used

The app is built using React and React hooks along with:

Axios npm package for fetching data from the api
React Bootstrap package for component elements
Export Table to Excel package for exporting the table to Excel

# Possible improvements

Further dropdowns for user to choose required data
Ability to edit/delete rows from the table
Options to export for more file types
ablity to push data to api
Futher enhancement to usability

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
